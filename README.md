# Project Two: Dummy Student List

<ins><b>Description</ins></b><br />
This project simulates a student-list management system with a low-code/no-code solution provided by Microsoft Power Apps. This project aimed to be able to update information in real time in collaboration with Google Sheets, ensuring that any changes made within the app are instantly reflected in the corresponding spreadsheet. The automated updates include student information (Name, Year, and Status), time & date created, and the generation of incremented Student IDs.

This video showcases the collaboration between Microsoft Power Apps and Google Sheets with real-time updates of student information. Since the template is already provided, the low-code/no-code is mainly used for data collection, page redirection, and 'app development.' <br />

An example line of code is the "Add User": <br />
![Image](CodeExample)<br />

This line itself does three things:<br />
- *NewForm(EditForm1)*: Create a new form for data entry
- *Navigate('Add New Student Info')*: Moves the user to the 'Add New Student Info' page which has the edit form.
- *ScreenTransition.None*: There should be no transition animation when navigating to the new page.
